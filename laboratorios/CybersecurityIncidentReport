# Cybersecurity Incident Report

## Scenario

You work as a security analyst for a travel agency that advertises sales and promotions on the company’s website. The employees of the company regularly access the company’s sales webpage to search for vacation packages their customers might like.

One afternoon, you receive an automated alert from your monitoring system indicating a problem with the web server. You attempt to visit the company’s website, but you receive a connection timeout error message in your browser.

You use a packet sniffer to capture data packets in transit to and from the web server. You notice a large number of TCP SYN requests coming from an unfamiliar IP address. The web server appears to be overwhelmed by the volume of incoming traffic and is losing its ability to respond to the abnormally large number of SYN requests. You suspect the server is under attack by a malicious actor.

You take the server offline temporarily so that the machine can recover and return to a normal operating status. You also configure the company’s firewall to block the IP address that was sending the abnormal number of SYN requests. You know that your IP blocking solution won’t last long, as an attacker can spoof other IP addresses to get around this block. You need to alert your manager about this problem quickly and discuss the next steps to stop this attacker and prevent this problem from happening again. You will need to be prepared to tell your boss about the type of attack you discovered and how it was affecting the web server and employees.

## Section 1: Incident Analysis

**Attack Type:**  
SYN Flood Denial of Service (DoS) Attack

**Attack Description:**  
A SYN Flood attack involves overwhelming a target server by sending a massive number of TCP SYN requests without completing the TCP three-way handshake. The server allocates resources for each incoming SYN request, waiting for the final ACK response to establish a connection. Because these connections are never completed, the server’s resources become exhausted, leading to degraded performance or complete denial of service.

In this scenario, packet analysis revealed an abnormally high volume of SYN packets originating from an unknown IP address, indicating a SYN Flood attack aimed at saturating the company’s web server.

**Observed Symptoms:**  
- The company website became inaccessible.  
- Browsers returned connection timeout errors.  
- The server was overwhelmed and unable to respond to legitimate requests.

## Section 2: Network Impact and Response

**Impact on the Network:**  
- The web server was overwhelmed by the excessive number of half-open TCP connections.  
- Employees and customers were unable to access the sales promotion webpage.  
- Potential loss of revenue and damage to the company’s reputation due to service unavailability.

**Potential Consequences:**  
- Direct financial loss from missed sales opportunities.  
- Customer dissatisfaction and diminished trust.  
- Increased vulnerability to further or more sophisticated attacks without preventive measures.

**Actions Taken:**  
- Temporarily disconnected the server to allow recovery.  
- Blocked the attacking IP address via firewall rules.

**Recommendations for Prevention:**  
- Deploy Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS).  
- Configure firewalls with SYN Flood protection mechanisms (e.g., SYN cookies).  
- Limit maximum concurrent half-open connections and reduce connection timeout intervals.  
- Consider leveraging cloud-based DDoS mitigation services to absorb malicious traffic.
