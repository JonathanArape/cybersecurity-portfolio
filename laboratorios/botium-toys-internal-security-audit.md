## 🧾 Recommendations

To improve its security posture and reduce the current high risk level (score: 8/10), Botium Toys should:

- Enforce least privilege and separation of duties.
- Implement a disaster recovery plan and backup strategy.
- Use encryption for sensitive data.
- Strengthen password policies and deploy a password manager.
- Install and configure an IDS.
- Schedule regular maintenance for legacy systems.

These improvements will help achieve compliance with key frameworks and better protect organizational assets.
